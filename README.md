# Weather-Dashboard-HW-6


A weather dashboard displays current weather and forecasts weather for searched cities. forcast will be for 5 days.

Approach
I started by dividing the main task into smaller tasks as below :
1. Get the user input city
2. Send the request to the Openweather server and retrieve the current weather and forecast
3. Show the information on screen
4. Create a button that does the same thing as steps 2 and 3 for the weather in that city again

I start working on HTML and CSS first and then look into functionality and Javascript. 
.

Challenges

Major challenges in this assignment was to have  5 days forecast using weather API. 

Getting the UV index for the searched cities was difficult, I called that from AJAX call which returns citiy longitude and latitude. 

I used name on the server to be capitalized, and want search history buttons appear only if the city is searchable. I simply used AJAX to call for that.
